Mouse: Turns the camera
WASD: Moves the camera around
QE: Zooms in and out
R: Speeds up the simulation
F: Slows down the simulation
Right-Click: Brings up a menu to reset the view or exit the simulation

In this version I have added some new camera features and cleaned up the code
a lot by putting a few of the repeated lines of code into their own functions.
Also changed the lighting around a bit, but couldn't get the effect that I wanted
with the planets having shade behind them.

Got help from Chris Hughes with the code to add the music.
